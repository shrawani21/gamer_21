## Description
Dot and Boxes is a classic pen-and-paper game where two players take turns connecting dots to form lines. When a player completes a box by forming the fourth side, they score a point and get another turn. The player with the most boxes at the end of the game wins.

- **Score Tracking:** Keep track of each player's score throughout the game.
- **Responsive Design:** Enjoy the game on various screen sizes, including mobile devices.
